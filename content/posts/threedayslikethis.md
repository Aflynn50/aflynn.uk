#### ♪ Three Days Like This ♪

By Alasdair and Alastair

_To the tune of: One Day Like This - Elbow_

\[Verse 1\]  
Drinking through the night gone by  
TV's on, I'm wondering why  
I never seem to get good sleep  
Yeah, missing my alarm go beep  
What made me behave this way  
Lying in another day  
I'm too late for the morning bus  
Oh anyway, its looking like a work from home day  
Someone calls me on my phone  
Urgent meeting, cover's blown  
I'm home today I've got a cold  
My excuses may be getting old  

\[Chorus\]  
Holy cow, its been three days  
I haven't seen the suns sweet rays  
Yeah, lying in bed half awake  
Oh anyway, its looking like a work from home day  

\[Verse 2\]  
Their camera's on and I'm in bed  
I say my laptops flashing red  
I can't believe I'm getting paid  
To do fuck all another day  

\[Chorus\]  
Holy cow, its been three days  
I haven't seen the suns sweet rays  
Yeah, lying in bed half awake  
Wondering what excuse I'll make  
Oh anyway its looking like a work from home day  

\[Outro\]  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!  
Throw those curtains shut  
Three days like this a week I don't get up!
