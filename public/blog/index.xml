      <description>Why is coping and pasting from tmux so utterly shit? Like to literally just get the command I typed I need to remember some arcane enchantment involving ctrl+b (referred to helpfully only as the &amp;ldquo;prefix&amp;rdquo; on stack overflow) followed by some sort for closing bracket, or is it opening? - quick google - ok its [. Now we&amp;rsquo;re in &amp;ldquo;copy mode&amp;rdquo; and we can use some esoteric movement keys to attempt to highlight my text.</description>

      <description>♪ Three Days Like This ♪ By Alasdair and Alastair
To the tune of: One Day Like This - Elbow
[Verse 1]
Drinking through the night gone by
TV&amp;rsquo;s on, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering why
I never seem to get good sleep
Yeah, missing my alarm go beep
What made me behave this way
Lying in another day
I&amp;rsquo;m too late for the morning bus
Oh anyway, its looking like a work from home day</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an adult now. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when it happened really, it just sort of snuck up on me. And I have to admit, it takes a bit of getting used to.
I can tell because I&amp;rsquo;m starting to experience all those things that adults talk about. Work has begun and the initial shock of it has mostly subsided. I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to feel as settled in this routine as I did in school, except this one has no end date.</description>
